# 😊 Text Emotion Detector
This repository contains the end-to-end implementation of a Text Emotion Detector using BERT, Docker, Jenkins, Streamlit, and AWS for deployment.

## 📝 Overview
The Text Emotion Detector classifies input text into six predefined emotion categories: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise. The project follows modern development practices, incorporating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and cloud deployment.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Emotion Detection**: Accurately predicts emotions from text inputs.
- 💻 **Streamlit UI**: A user-friendly interface for inputting text and viewing predictions.
- 🐳 **Dockerized Deployment**: Fully containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrated Jenkins pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
- ☁️ **AWS Deployment**: Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance for scalable cloud access.

## ⏳ Dataset

The model was trained on the [Emotions Dataset for NLP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp?select=train.txt) available on Kaggle. The dataset includes 16,000 training samples, 2,000 validation samples, and 2,000 test samples, with the following emotion labels:
- Anger 😡
- Fear 😨 
- Joy 😊
- Love ❤️
- Sadness 😢
- Surprise 😲

### 🛠️ Steps to Run the Project
#### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bapurolling/Text_Emotion_Detector.git
cd Text_Emotion_Detector
```

#### 2. Build and Run the Docker Container:
```bash
docker build -t text_emotion_detector .
docker run -p 8501:8501 text_emotion_detector
```
#### 3. Access the App:
